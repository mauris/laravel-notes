laravel-notes
=============

In my quest to learn and build Laravel apps, I find some parts of the official documentation missing and forum posts / Stack Overflow questions having unreliable or missing answers. After much sourcing, I have found some of these missing answers and was able incorporate into my app.

As I began to pick up, I decide that it would be best if I can document them down.

## Version

As of now, all documentation is correct and working for Laravel 4.1.x, and some may still work for future Laravel 4.2.x.

## Topics

- [Authentication](Authentication.md)
- [Blade](Blade.md)
- [Forms](Forms.md)
- [Mail](Mail.md)
- [Validator](Validator.md)
